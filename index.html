				<p2>After the pandemic-driven recession in 2020, the island (i.e., the Philippines) is still experiencing economic and food crisis.</p2>
				<img class="project-img" src="./assets/img/foodwaste.jpg">
				<p2>Agriculture plays a huge role in the lives of Filipinos. However, our nation still <strong style="color:red;">struggles when it comes to food security</strong>. Shortage of food supply coming from the agricultural sector is common. Leading causes are rampant hoarding, inadequate government policies, and unforeseen natural crises. In 2023, to combat increasing price of rice, President Marcos declared price ceiling to rice products fueling economic insecurity of farmers. Subsequently, this policy adds pressure in producing food crops and in selling them in the market. 
					In line with this, cases of vegetables, such as cabbages, being wasted or sold at a loss due to oversupply in the food supply chain increases. This is food that could be bought by the government and reallocated to starving families. </p2>
				<p2>With the ever <strong style="color:red;">increasing population growth and unpredictable crises</strong>, the capacity to produce food for the population is hampered. Sustainable agriculture and food production is needed now more than ever.</p2>

				<h1 class="modal-subtitle">It is time to plan out on how you will organize your data</h1>
				<p2>You establish the following steps to ensure the quality of the data.</p2>
			</div>

		<button class="collapsible">Data Gathering</button>
			<div class="contentcollapse">
				<p2>The team gathered most of the required data from the database maintained by the <strong style="color:red">Philippine Statistical Authority (PSA)</strong>. Various datasets were collected with varying temporal (i.e. Period or Datetime) granularity and range (with a unified range of 1994-2023). However, due to granularity issues, only the annualized range 2012-2023 were used for hypothesis testing, but the entire 1994-2023 range is still used for machine learning as detailed later.</p2>
				<br><br>
				<p2>To autonomously gather the data from PSA, the team developed scrapers using Mechanical Soup.</p2>
				<br><br>
				<p2>Due to the limitations of the scraper, the team also developed a program to compile fragmented datasets into one with the help of Pandas.</p2>
			</div>
		
		<button class="collapsible">Preprocessing</button>
			<div class="contentcollapse">
				<p2>You begin to sanitize and standardize the data you've collected:</p2>
				<br>
				<p2 style="display: list-item; margin-left: 20px;">For proper format consistency, Year and Months column were properly arranged in chronological order. Additionally, textcases for some elements were fixed.</strong></p2>
				<br>
				<p2 style="display: list-item; margin-left: 20px;">Converted and validated all ".." and 0 elements to blank representations for easy NA representation.</p2>
				<br>
				<p2 style="display: list-item; margin-left: 20px;">Removed columns such as "Annual" and "Average" that can be derived from current data to reduce data clutter.</p2>
				<br>
				<p2 style="display: list-item; margin-left: 20px;">Region-Province relationships were derived and kept into a separate file, and multiple region name corrections had to be done (e.g. ARMM vs BARMM).</p2>
                <br>
                <p2 style="display: list-item; margin-left: 20px;">Aside from geolocation naming issues, bad and non-standard commodity names and period names (e.g. abbreviated months vs. full months) also had to be fixed.</p2>
                <br>
                <p2 style="display: list-item; margin-left: 20px;">Period values standardized to the range 1994-2023, either Yearly, Quarterly, or Monthly (Yearly is where most the datasets intersect, hence it is used for hypothesis testing). Reduced number of features however are used for machine learning, hence allowing 1994-2023 Quarterly and Monthly to be used.</p2>

					<p2><em>To answer the problem, you will be testing your hypotheses at a standard 0.05 level of significance.</em></p2>
					<br><br><br>
					<p2>To determine whether or not a <b>significant relationship</b> exists between the Market Indicators and Agricultural Indicators you collected, you used <em>Pearson Correlation Coefficient</em>. This allows you to measure the strength of their potential correlations. You used all observations for both rice and corn for this.</p2>
					<br><br>
					<iframe src="./results/hypothesis2.html" style="border:none;height:500px;width:680px; overflow-y:hidden" title="Market Indicator & Agricultural Indicator Pearson R"></iframe>
					<br><br>
					<p2>You observed several interesting relationships, such as the fact that higher Self-Sufficiency Ratio relates to lower food prices in the capital (NCR RPI), and the inverse is true. This is just one of your many exciting realizations.</p2>
					<br><br><br><br>
					<p2>In analyzing if significant difference exists between rice and corn in terms of both agricultural and socioeconomic indicators when grouped by regions, you used <em>two-way t-test</em>. The sample graph helps in visualizing this idea.</p2>

					<p2>Wow! You realize that certain food crops differ in profitability, abundance, and costs, among others, in certain regions.</p2>
					<br><br><p2><em>You feel like you're getting close to unraveling the island's mysteries.</em></p2>

				<p2>Certain that there are still more underlying patterns in the data that are waiting to be discovered, you then decide to perform the sophisticated art of machine learning. The results of your machine learning experiments greatly excites you, so much that you decide to simultaneously reveal ALL in the steps and results of said experiment altogether with your EDA results during the townhall meeting. In doing so (i.e. deferring the ML inner workings to the Results section ), you are also showcasing the science behind your methods, which could further pique the interest of the islanders in the beauty of data science and how it can help solve society's most pressing problems.</p2>
                <br>
                <p2>Armed with these knowledge and robust machine learning models, you press on towards the townhall meeting.</p2>

				<p2>This is the culmination of your research on this island. It is time to tell the isle-folks your findings and help them make an <strong style="color: red;">informed decision for their future</strong>.</p2>
				<p2>You started with discussing the insights you gained while exploring the data.</p2>

			<button class="collapsible">Discussion of Analysis</button>
				<div class="contentcollapse">
					<p2><strong style="color: red;">Result 1:</strong> The significant correlations and regional differences highlight that some market conditions, such as inflation rate, play a role in determining agricultural productivity. Generally, a low price on grains signifies a high self-sufficiency ratio for the agricultural sector.</p2>
					<br><br>
					<p2><strong style="color: red;">Result 2:</strong> Despite having growing stocks on grains every year, prices still continue to grow. This can be attributed to the continuous growth of the population and increasing reliance on much more expensive imported grains.</p2>
					<br><br>
					<p2><strong style="color: red;">Result 3:</strong> Policies attempting to stabilize rice and corn supplies only work for a short period of time. This highlights the weakness of the island to find solutions for sustainable agriculture and a stable market.</p2>

				<p2>With this information, you think you can help the people realize the importance of the study by showing the prediction of the future of their agriculture.</p2>

					<p2>Your EDA has given you more confidence that more patterns in your data can be learned. That is, there are more nuances embedded in the data than meets the (statistical) eye.</p2>
                    <br><br><p2>During this portion of your presentation, you showcase your ML experiments from start to finish to supplement your EDA findings and to better show the use of ML models for time-series analysis and forecasting (e.g. in predicting how the island's agriculture might perform in the near future).  "Give a man a bowl of rice and he eats for a day, give a man a love for data science and he can model agricultural trends to get plenty more rice." </p2>
					<br><br>
					<p2>You focus your analysis on rice and its two agricultural indicators that are most important for the people: <strong style="color: red;">volume of rice production</strong> and <strong style="color: red;">rice stocks</strong>.</p2>
					<br><br>
					<p2>By preprocessing data and getting exogenous variables (e.g. the market indicators) that you deemed helpful in your model's prediction, you are now prepared to split the data into training and testing sets.</p2>
					<br><br>
					<p2>To actually find out which regression model suits best with the given data, you analyze their performance or the quality of their predictions using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error">Mean Absolute Percentage Error</a> (MAPE) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination"> Coefficient of Determination </a> (R2). MAPE is to minimized while R2 is to be maximized while performing other validation to avoid overfitting.</p2>
                    <br><br><p2>After optimization and various experimentations on different models and parameter sets with respect to MAPE and R2, you determine that Elastic Net CV is the best model for predicting the (quarterly) volume of rice production and that Random Forest Regressor is the best model for predicting (monthly) rice stocks. The validation plots of these models are shown below.</p2>

					<p2>You found that the volume of rice production on the island would likely stay the same in the near future, while the rice stocks on the island, despite dipping for a short period, can eventually rebound. You share the news of better days ahead to the celebration of the islanders. The anomaly is in fact not an anomaly, but a pattern to be understood. Through your experiments, you also found out that various combinations of the market indicators have very minimal impact on the quality of the predictions, hence you are more keen to acknowledge that the answer to your primary research question is that the tested market indicators are only <strong style="color: red;">weakly correlated</strong> to agricultural productivity.</p2>
					<br><br>
					<p2>The people thanks you for giving them these models as these will help them people make an informed decision about future policies and redirect their prospects towards a more sustainable agriculture.</p2>

				<br>
				<h1 class="modal-subtitle">This led you to <strong style="color: red;">conclude</strong> that...</h1>
				<p2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;">Economic factors <strong style="color: red;">only weakly affect</strong> food crop productivity, but government policies such as price ceilings and revised tarrifs, as well as climate phenomenona such as El Niño evidently affect food crop productivity as seen through time series analysis. This highlights towards the potential role of market conditions and more explicitly government policies in regulating agricultural productivity.</p2>
				<br><br>
				<p2>With this conclusion in mind, you connected it to the following implications for the future of cereal crops in the island.</p2>
			</div>

			<button class="collapsible">Implications</button>
				<div class="contentcollapse">
					<p2>This overall highlights that the island is <strong style="color: red;">not self-sufficient</strong> in terms of both rice and corn production. Analysis suggests that being self-sufficient is a key to lower domestic prices on food crops and can stabilize market conditions. </p2>
					<br><br>
					<p2>In relation to this, the island is currently experiencing inflation on rice prices. This can be attributed to the fact that the local production is low and expensive sanctions on cereal crops imports. Furthermore, having to rely on imports also introduces competition to domestic producers which harms the ability of the island to truly sustain itself.</p2>
					<br><br>
					<p2>All this trickles down to the realization that the <strong style="color: red;">current laws and policies of the government</strong> towards food sustainability is <strong style="color: red;">not enough</strong>. Analysis shows that food crops are affected by some market factors and policies currently imposed. With continuous population growth, policymakers should consider focusing on strategies pertaining to sustainable agriculture and market stability.</p2>
				</div>

			<div class="modal-content-wrapper" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
				<br>
				<p2>Lastly, to help the people decide about their future, you discuss the following limitations and recommendations.</p2>
			</div>

			<button class="collapsible">Limitations & Recommendations</button>
				<div class="contentcollapse">
					<br>
					<p2>The limitations of the project comes from the dataset itself. Certain data points or indicators are missing or not up-to-date, it could affect the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the analysis. Furthermore, certain regions may have more comprehensive data compared to others, leading to unequal representation and can affect the generalizability of the findings.</p2>
					<br><br>
					<p2>For <strong style="color: red;">future endeavors</strong>, you recommend the following:</p2>
					<br><br>
					<p2 style="display: list-item; margin-left: 40px;">A comprehensive and updated dataset of different economic and crop production from different regions of the island can help narrow down definitive conclusions about the current agricultural and economic condition of the island.</p2> 
					<br>
					<p2 style="display: list-item; margin-left: 40px;">A more targeted analysis technique that is appropriate for economic analysis could bring out more information on the effects of market conditions on crop production.</p2> 
					<br>
					<p2 style="display: list-item; margin-left: 40px;">This topic could be continued using other agricultural products such as livestock and other food products that could give new insights on this problem.</p2> 
					<br>
					<p2 style="display: list-item; margin-left: 40px;">Encourage support for local farmers and their products by making informed decisions when it comes to voting those who will run the island. </p2> 
				</div>

			<div class="modal-content-wrapper" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
				<br>
				<p2>Feeling contented, you hope that you encourage the people to act and make informed decision to solve their current problems.</p2>
				<p2>It is time to rest and ponder on what you achieved.</p2>
