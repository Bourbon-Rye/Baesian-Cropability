# Baesian-Cropability

The project aims to analyse the potential relation of different market conditions to food productivity in the Philippines. In general, we would explore the impact of economic forces to our agricultural sector using different statistical analysis and machine learning tools. This in the service of helping achieve SDG 4 Zero Hunger of the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.

## Environment

To set up the `baesians` environment, tweak first the bundled `environment.yml` file and replace the `prefix` parameter with the path to your Anaconda or Miniconda installation. I.e. replace `C:\Users\YSHebron\anaconda3\envs\baesians` with possibly `C:\Users\<username>\anaconda3\envs\baesians` if you're on Windows and using Anaconda, or `/home/<username>/miniconda3/envs/scl` if you're on Linux and using Miniconda.

Then, create an environment using the bundled `environment.yml` file:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the new environment using `conda activate baesians`. Verify that the environment was installed correctly using `conda env list`.
